 Extract the files in a new folder named SDL in C-drive.

Set Up SDL library, and edit paths in environment variables.

NOTE-:If you do not want any change in Environment variables you can do if you have a 32-bit os- g++ metro_project.cpp -o metro_project -IC:\SDL\SDL2-2.28.2\include -LC:\SDL\SDL2-2.28.2\lib\x86 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lmingw32 or g++ metro_project.cpp -o metro_project -IC:\SDL\SDL2-2.28.2\include -LC:\SDL\SDL2-2.28.2\lib\x64 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lmingw32 for 64 Bit OS. in terminal.

After this, an executable file will be created which you can run.
